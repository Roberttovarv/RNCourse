# To-Do List in React Native

In this project, you'll find a small app created with **React Native**.

- The behavior is implemented using **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Styling is done using built-in **style properties**.

## Features

- You can add a new task by pressing the **"Add new goal"** button.
- You can delete tasks by simply tapping on them.
- When the keyboard is opened to create a new task, the view resizes so it is not obstructed.
- When you add a new goal or cancel the addition, the input field is reset.
